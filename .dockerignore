app/models/           # Contains wavlm_analyzer.py and potentially downloaded model weights
monitoring/ml_batch_processor.py # The script for the ML cron job

# Large files or directories not needed in the final image
# Add any other large files or folders that are in your project root but not needed in the Docker image
# For example, if you had a 'datasets/' folder, you'd add:
# datasets/
